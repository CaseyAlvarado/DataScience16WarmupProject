I would be curious to play with the parameters and see what that does for the model."

    "When we translated the port names into numerical values in order to include the embankment ports as a part of our predictors, we said that S = 0, C = 1, and Q = 2. I think it would be interesting to change this to have three more columns where the first column would be S = 0 or 1, the second column would be C = 0 or 1, and the third column would be Q = 0 or 1. Currently, embarking at different ports provides different mathematical advantages. Embarking at port Q provides 2 whereas embarking at port S provides 0 points. These port values should not be multiples of each other. The ports should all be equal, this might contribute to overfitting. I think this would get us closer to the true fit. "
